# OneshotGB
Oneshot GB now in github!
Putting it on github since thats 10x easier than mediafire for anyone to obtain and it would make it easier to work on the project for me.
Also served as me trying out git bash (and failing)
The main branch is where the 2.0.0 demo is currently being worked on


Update format

Minor: Bugfixes
Moderate:New visual content, little to no new content, Aka nothing playable
Working Progress: Working on content which once finished, will be considered "Major"
Major: Playable content, like a continuation of the story, or a new inventory system

2.0.0 demo promises

Improved Inventory system backend since 8 items was about the limit my mind could handle if the nested if statements i used (i was sort of losing my mind)
Entirety of the Barrens area (big goal but hey! if i never finish it, someone else can since this is a public github page!)
No color support!


# NOTICE: MAIN BRANCH IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK, V2OLD IS

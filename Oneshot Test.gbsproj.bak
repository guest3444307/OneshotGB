(fixed some issues with triggers at the password enter area) (i hate it that attach script is no longer saved across scenes, like why!)\n1/6/22: Minor Bug fix (just one)\n1/10/22: new text files added\n1/11/22: Implemented a fix on the lack of persistence of attach script by adding it to all scenes that need it, not efficent but what can i do! I also set up some plans into the New inventory system (code rework, maybe try out the new dialog prompt since ive seen cool things in the discord!\n1/12/22: Menu works now! also readded the dev sprite, returned speed to 1 from 1.5 to fix trigger bug discovered why the fireplace bug is happening, maybe ill finally speak in the discord since i have no clue about this\n1/14/22: Nothing today, just took a crack at the sprite issue and I've got nothing, for some reason it just happens, maybe a 8x16 piece doesn't work? or maybe the niko sprite is broken, 3.0 has its issues.\n1/21/22: god damn it, i really should ask the discord for help, i tried just replacing the sprite that got replaced and it just bloody messed with a different sprite, the only solution i see is to replace every sprite every time, it seems to be tied to replacing the player sprite (why!!! also noticed a difference in speed between color when trying to see if that would fix anything suggesting poor performance (should've seen that coming with how poorly optimized this is!)\n1/22/22 (part 1): IVE GOD DAMN CRACKED THE BLODDY CODE, ITS THAT BULB SPRITE, ILL TRY FIXING IT NOW!!!\n1/22/22 (part 2): finally i mostly fixed it, all it took was arbitarily matching the sprite sheet, and 1 frame of glitchy sprite for it to inexplicibly work, well now its time to implement a new inventory system\n1/23/22: instead of working on a new inventory system i went and worked on the next map, BARRENS! nothing there really, just the map, i tried out some new techniques + the whole http://cache.andre-michelle.com/tools/html/tileset-extractor.html website to do it, and i got it done in about the time it originally took me to do just the living room (i did the living room by hand completly in paint.net, only going into tiled if its too big i think i should call this a moderate update since we are outside the house now.\n1/24/22: Added a few Niko Faces for fun, improved the one already there at least, not actually added, anything new.\n1/25/22: Added more Niko faces and modified some\n1/25/22 part 2: Added a new bg to the new inventory system and did slight work on it, i also found out why the menu was so much slower than before!\n1/28/22: Worked a bit on the arrow in the inventory system! it works a bit better.\n2/4/22: Worked a bit on the inventory system, no new content, just touched up on the project.\n2/12/22: Added my burden is light midi2mod converted to by OblivionAxis. hopefully they wont object to this\n4/12/22: Touched the project to make 1 change (specifically worked on the new item screen, it now detects whether or not you picked up a item in slot 1, you can tell by this gap in progress that i have some good work ethic! I can easily expand this to all three current item slots, though right now im questioning my current setup for this rework, and im considering returning the menu back to how the original worked (with the player actor moving the menu with triggers) instead of a binded solution to return the holding down functionality.\n4/13/22: More inventory stuff, interaction doesn't work but item slots 1-3 should show the proper items in the slot, also i have no clue how i did item slots before... I'm not joking i spent like 30 minutes looking for how i did it, and i could not figure it out. This is why im making a new inventory system from scratch, that old inventory system is a ancient dragon to fight against every single time since i did not use scripts, so every change i made i had to paste across everything, it was horrible and it was the cause of 90% of bugs in the game while debugging. (time at least, because when your nested if statements become so long that you have to literally drag the block based coding sidebar (not sure what to call it) to even see, you have a problem.) I was happy when i finished the inventory system since finally, i dont have to touch it anymore. Sorry for rambling, had to get that off my chest. Oh also in changes, if i did this right i set it to 14 actors on screen total in a scene just for the new inventory system, though im questioning if i need it to be like this or if i could just mimic a scrolling inventory system by changing all the actors instead of making a actual scrolling inventory system (though that would enter into hell territory!)\n4/14/22: ive gotten the new inventory system fully working in the Original demo area, ill have to test things out to get it working in the expanded demo, the current plans is to get a remastering of the Original demo out there, just as a goal as it's much simpler to do that, where i can next get to V2.1.0 (yes thats the idea if im keeping up with this numbering system!) I've always been thinking of this but now is the time ill put it into text. There ARE bugs since i havent fully tested it but it probably works, which is the goal.\n4/15/22: Should've checked more deeply but nope, its broken still, it's easy to just bring that data back as 15-20 minutes of checking had me find the issue but i want to make it easier to work on this in the future with scripts. So i did some work on that.\n4/16/22: Nevermind, I'll just copy and paste it, better to do it manually since theres only 1 inventory screen. More effort than needed. It works, its slightly bugged since it doesn't have it automatically change it, but i can fix that later. (man i have a lot to work and fix)\n4/29/22: Alright i've added some changes to the new item system, i haven't checked fully but it should hopefully work basically i've done work to implement fixes for the item slot bugs and also some work to make the how item slots move less reliant on directly stated positions (so if needed the inventory can be more easily made to take advantage of multiple item slots in the different rows without having to rework all of it.\n5/9/22: Currently working on making it so that you can't move the cursor over empty item slots, its currently buggy but im making progress on it.\n5/16/22: i figured out why the cursor kept being dropped lower than it should, it was because the only choice for being kept into the same slot was to drop to the lowest part (for example 3,8 which can cause the issue of it dropping down into another item slot.) I got the system i wanted sort of working only on the right version, i'll implement the left one next time.\n5/17/22: I finally finished how the left and right works in the inventory, I'll work on it more later, though now that im thinking about it, i dont really need the Inventory for 2.0.0 update as the 1.0 inventory still works fine, is bug free as far as i know, and works with what little the demo gives you at that point. I guess i could just migrate over all of my changes into the old screen and call it a day for the inventory, though that'll be for the next update i guess.\n5/21/22: Made attempts to fix Inventory system bug of the combining system. still nothing. Im not sure why it wont work.\n5/26/22: I might be jinxing myself, but i think i finally finished the inventory system! I literally can't think of anything else! WOOOOOOOO! i started to focus on this since april 12th, this is the closest thing i've ever had to a proper scedule for this project of weekly updates. I'll focus on fixing bugs in the area and implementing the new faces in scenes, I've already tried an experiment by changing Niko's eyes to green since it should hopefully look more like niko's actual eyes, i wish i could get something closer more naturally but unless i expand the sprite (which brings in new problems like possibly needing to rebuild the maps. I'll also try color support.\n5/27/22: I went and worked on the SGB border, right now there is a temp one based of an edited image of the window of the World Machine Edition.\n5/28/22: Basic GBC implementation, im experimenting with the color tool and such, I've made a few palletes and such for generic scenes, Right now im planning on making GBC specific scenes to make better use of colorize without making things look worse in the original GameBoy. Maybe there could be a part 2 later today, though that depends on my mood. Also decided to try to implement yellow to niko's eyes but that didn't work for whatever reason. I'll try a bit more later.\n5/28/22 Part 2: I did the Niko eyes thing (Though i'll have to finish it later as i've been working for a few hours, i need to pace myself, i have also implemented a mirror into my game,  the idea just overtook me for some reason, so i did it. It probably looks horrible in DMG since overlaying sprites over another doesn't work properly there, so i will have to implement a color check there. \n5/29/22: More Color support added, Also added checks for color to allow for the best possible experience on both consoles. Though i've likely introduced a bug with the stick, There isn't much of an issue due to the fact you can't save in the Start area.\n5/29/22 part 2: I worked more on color support, oh god the palletes, i've already made so many. And i just realized i'm saving over some of the original gb ones... I'll fix that later. Today just isn't my day tbh. To be specific on what i've worked on, i've added color to some of the lightbulb pickup scene, looks pretty good.\n5/30/22: Oh my god, i wish i had someone else do the coloring for me, like jesus  this is unironcially painful if i want it to look good, i spent like an hour on one just now. Its b2 (b0-2 GBC, right panel) , it took like 8 palletes for that, and lots of funny edits you can't see in color (like using black, the background color on places where you can't see the background, man this would look weird on DMG, not the weirdest as that belongs to wake4 (or 5, they are basically the same) Maybe i'll go and work on something else for now.\n6/1/22: Just a quick and short update, fixed the color of the Start area black, as i accidentaly messed it up. I've made attempts to go and fix the sprites on the stairs, though its only slightly better.\n6/3/22: Minor color touchup to B3, nothing much otherwise.\n6/4/22: More work on b3, sadly might have to go back and edit b2 to be simpler for parity reasons.\n6/6/22: tried to use fix the stairs, so they wont work for a while until i geth them working... I'm genuinely considering making these a cutscene.\n6/8/22: I Went and just turned it into a cutscene, I can't be bothered with this anymore. I've lost to the stairs. i knew this about the stairs, I hope this doesn't keep on happening (homestuck joke) Slightly buggy but i can't care anymore. Maybe i should step away from this project for a bit due to how i have to color the rest of these. I don't really like coloring too much tbh, its interesting but it is mind numbingly painful at times.\n7/10/22: Minor coloring to b4 gbc just to try and get back on working on this project.\n7/21/22: Finishing b3 and b4 gbc (maybe some touchup in the future, but it's good enough for now)\n7/21/22 part 2: b5 and b6 completed, Honestly i hope to try and get a bit of a team going for this if i were to continue. My pace is slow as this is a large project and im not motivated to work on it at all times. Like seriously. I would've released this much earlier if i didn't try implementing color, but i was suggested it by my brother when i showed him this and i thought it wouldn't be too hard, well i guess it would be easy if i was lazy and didn't try to make the look the best they possibly could but still. I have zero experience running a team for a modding project but that doesn't mean i'll do a terrible job. I just have to setup a goal and coordinate with others, not have high standards and also not expect a fast pace from them either since i'm pretty slow on this thing myself. Sorry for turning this into a blog but i feel like it's good to document my thoughts like this on the project. Maybe it'll be nice to look back later and read these.\n7/22/22: Minor coloring on b7 b8 b9, mainly temp for b8 and b9 which i did in 1 minute,. B7 has some issues which need to be fixed\n7/23/22: Lazily put it b7 b8 b9 together, can't really bother making changes to make it look better at the moment. I should go and remake all the maps now! maybe there will be a part 2, maybe not, depends on how i feel.\n7/25/22 & 7/26/22: worked on a new title screen for 2 hours, did this kind of late so it became the 26th. I'll continue working on this later. for now i put up a temporary screen for this until i properly adjust it\n7/26/22 part 2: Finished that title screen for GBC and GB maybe i could adjust the text in the GBC since its not particularly good colors since i changed the pallete. I'm going to work on the UI tommorow as i hadn't thought of changing the default UI until now. I made a temp asset from resizing and modifying from the original game which i'll get around to converting\n7/27/22: I'm a bit limited with UI as the colors  for the avatars and the Ui share the same pallete sadly, tinted it yellowish. Maybe i'll go back to it later but it looks fine for now. I'll continue work later.\n7/28/22:  remade the living room with my newer method.  there might be bugs until then, i know there might be visual issues with the fire but i can fix that later.\n9/11/22: (edgy joke incoming!) Happy 9/11!  I'm preparing for a World Machince Launch for this. i've gotten busy for a while on my CAPStone project, meaning i don't have as much time to dedicate here, so the goal is to clean this up a bit and release it soon as the 2.0 Beta world machine release Also moved to 3.1\n12/11/22: Finally Fixed the Cutscene bug for the stairs, my god that took way too long, but the game is finally feature complete, just needs some visual touchups, hoping for a Christmas 2022 release\n12/21/22: made some more changes unaccounted for here,but for the changes in the now, i've made a new bathroom and got the mirror up and ruinning, though im thinking of changing the mirror as niko is no longer showing up properly due to the grid.\n2/10/23: Fixed the mirror misalignment, preparing for an early Christmas release as a treat, just ignore the 2022 there! now need to deal with the dissapearing sprites.\n2/14/23 & 5/3/23: Worked a bit more on matching up the mirror properly, its misaligned, i said i fixed it earlier, but that may have been an older version? I dunno, I have an idea to swap the sprite depending on your position, but it hasn't been implemented. I also fixed me accidentally lising the date as still being 2022 here.\n5/19/23: Worked more on the mirror,  the method i described kinda worked! but it flickers due to changing sprites, im thinking of maybe trying to have both mirrors in the scene but just hiding them, so i swap between the two mirrors instead of swapping sprites. I tested the concept by having a hidden version of one of the mirrors in the same place and it worked. so ill try that soon.\n9/15/23: I always come back... The mirror is in a completely functional state, i just need to change the pallete on some sprites and there we go! I've also optimized Niko's luminous yellow eyes (used to be 2, now its 1), the last thing i did was change the pallete of the docks as a quick test. Man it's insane to think about the fact that i started this back in like the 10th grade, and now i've graduated. Since then i've made a game in unity. (Very annoyed about that fee, i want to move to godot now, I already wanted to before, but this is the push i needed) I also as of writing have yet to release it, i have a bad habit of nearly finishing something, then leaving it to rot for like 6 months, I finished it, i just need to compile the newest build... But anyways, 2.0.0. is nearly finished, I'm going to try and go for The World Machine's 1st anniversary! (9/22) Imagine if i miss it again. Now whats next is to add those changes to the bulb editon, And redo.... THE STAIRS (THE VIETNAM FLASHBACKS DEAR GOD)\n9/16/23: I got the colors working for the most part. I adjusted the NIKO MIRROR sprite a bit, changed to fade to black to see if that looks fine. Right now there are still TWO more things to work on for the mirror 1 is the left bug where niko stops moving, 2 is the right bug where a bit of niko sticks out, 3 is the sink missing a color due to limitations as i need to keep this under 7 sprites (thanks to the eyes. It's great to work on this again\n9/17/23: The mirror mostly works now, Just need to add in the sink and fix the small bleedover on the right side if you time your movements JUST right. I also am trying music again with me recreating (ripping off entirely) Winstick's cover of My Burden is Light for this game, ill ask for permission if i make any headway with this idea\n9/17/23 P2 & 9/18/23: I played with the sound effects a bit to make the sound better. I'm also beginning to rework the stairs, taking the ideas from the new mirror setup, It doesn't work at all at the moment, This also means the stairs don't work at the moment. But if this works, It means the stairs will work seamlessly. So prepare for NIKO BOT 2000\n9/18/23 P2 & 9/19/23 & 9/20/23 & 9/21/23 & 9/28/23: I added some collision i missed at first and starting thinking ahead on what to do with 2.1.0, I tried reworking the stairs again and changed my mind, i then tried my hand with another music track since i heard of a method to Copy and past midis manually to UGE, and it worked! Someplace i know is now fully functional, it sounds bad, but it works i guess... I then decided to try My burden is light using another cover, and it came out so much better, due to the fact i didn't have to mess with Openmpt to lower the channel count. The midi i took from the internet was a fairly simple conversion, with some fixes needed, and then, it became amazing. Like god damn. I then decided to remove the First one i made since i didn't like it, I also removed old MOD files due to them being unneeded now. I still havent gotten permission for My Burden is Light as of writing but thats because the creator hasn't responded to my comment on youtube or their musescore. I'm also getting a Gameboy DMG for this, i wanted a color but i found a pretty good deal on a DMG so thats what im going with for now. Lets hope this comment ages well. Since you know what they say about good deals on the internet.\n9/28/23 P2: & 9/30/23 I just realized i missed the first world machince anniversary... Why did i try going for that in the first place I didn't even have time to finish polishing everything. I am going for a DEC 8 release or sooner if possible though. Also My Burden Is Light is XXOs' version, not Winsticks, i changed my mind and forgot to mention it. I also made a personal Trello to try and keep things organized. I also fixed the stairs and retested the inventory system to see if it still worked.\n10/3/23: Minor change to normal face, added a bit more to the trello. Still no response from XXOs but i found their discord, I guess I'll ask them there too, but tommorow as its getting a bit late. It also might not work because they haven't posted in the Oneshot Discord in two years but they could also be a lurker\n10/6/23: I got permission! I finally went in and added the new eyes to niko's sprite, I also fixed the weird flickers of white on the scarf which was caused by a slightly off shade of green(Miscoloring by bucket tool back in 2021 when i was adding the transparency i guess) I also adjusted the dialogue box to look a bit more like Oneshot, though i can't redo the coloring sadly as it applies to both avatars and the borders, Maybe i should make it B&W, I made some minor improvements to the faces and made them more consistent, especially once i realized i could use all 4 colors (a fact i seemingly forgot as the Louis sprite has dark green) I also added more stuff into the Dev room and some fun info on the Docks Map for anyone that visits it in the 2.0.0 Demo\n10/7/23: added a sprite that covers the screen in the START Screen to deal with the issues there, I might remake this titlescreen in the future? I dunno but it looks much better now\n10/10/23: Minor face updates, I've also done some extra work on planning 2.1.0, specifically a titlescreen remake.\n10/22/23: I worked a bit on the CG Wake cutscene's visuals, Did you know that The yellow on the eyes is the brightest Yellow i can use? I just noticed that, so i had to make the eye shadow part this darkish orange.\n12/8/23: RELEASE. it's not as polished as i'd like but i'd like to get this out now. It's mainly minor things anyways, fixed some bugs. I added some dev logs in game like last time. YADA YADA\n_________________________\nONESHOT GB DEMO V2.0.1\n_________________________\n5/12/24: I'm back, because im bored and these stairs have been on my mind for a while, I'm not entirely sure what im doing for V2.0.1 but it's basically fixing bugs and patching stuff. Plus a trailer, because i never did that.\n9/24/24: Port to GBSTUDIO 4.1. Havent fully tested Just did this to make things easier later.",

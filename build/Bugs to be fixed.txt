V 2.0.0 Bugs

Need to fix the problem with the fact that attach script to button no longer presists, so i need to add it back in manually!
would help to rework the inventory system, as its not optimized at all, it lags hard now for whatever reason and its hell to work with.
theres a bug with the fireplace, for whatever reason it changed its sprite to niko, but only for 2 of the four frames, extremely confusing!
